# Social Media Dashboard
The Social Media Dashboard is a web-based platform designed to aggregate data from various social media platforms and display metrics such as follower count, engagement rate, and popular posts in a centralized dashboard. It provides users with insights into their social media performance and helps them track key metrics to inform their social media strategy.

Features
Multi-Platform Aggregation: The dashboard supports integration with multiple social media platforms, including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn. Users can connect their accounts from these platforms to aggregate data and metrics from their social media profiles.

Metric Visualization: The dashboard displays social media metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) in interactive charts and graphs, allowing users to visualize trends and analyze their social media performance over time. Metrics include follower count, engagement rate, likes, comments, shares, and impressions.

Customizable Dashboard: Users can customize their dashboard to display specific metrics and data relevant to their social media goals and objectives. Customization options include selecting social media platforms, choosing metrics to display, and configuring date ranges for data analysis.

Real-Time Updates: The dashboard provides real-time updates and notifications for changes in social media metrics, such as sudden increases or decreases in follower count, spikes in engagement rate, or trending posts. Users can stay informed about their social media performance and respond promptly to emerging trends or opportunities.

Competitor Analysis: In addition to monitoring their own social media performance, users can compare their metrics with those of competitors or industry benchmarks. The dashboard provides tools for benchmarking and competitive analysis, allowing users to identify areas for improvement and strategies for growth.

Technologies Used
Frontend: The frontend of the dashboard is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Additional libraries and frameworks include React Router for client-side routing, Redux for state management, and Chart.js for data visualization.

Backend: The backend of the dashboard is built using Node.js, a server-side JavaScript runtime, and Express.js, a web application framework for Node.js. Data is stored in a MongoDB database using Mongoose, an ODM (Object-Document Mapping) library for Node.js.

Authentication: User authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and bcrypt for secure password hashing. Sessions are managed using HTTP cookies for persistent login sessions.

Social Media APIs: Integration with social media platforms is achieved using their respective APIs, which provide access to data and metrics from users' social media profiles. APIs used include the Twitter API, Facebook Graph API, Instagram Graph API, and LinkedIn API.
